\section{External Interface Requirements}

\subsection{User Interfaces}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}

\subsection{Software Interfaces}
The system will need to interface with the following software:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{A git-compatible software} {-} in order to create git repositories for
            the battles, push them to Github and clone students repositories in order to evaluate
            them
      \item \textbf{Language-specific software build systems} {-} in order to be able to build
            the students projects for evaluation. Different languages have their own
            requirements for compiling and executing code, so for each supported language
            the system will need to interact with one or more tools, at minimum with a
            compiler or interpreter (e.g gcc or clang for C/C++, javac for Java, node for
            JavaScript) but more likely with more complex tools (such as make for C/C++,
            Maven or Gradle for Java, npm for JavaScript)
      \item \textbf{Language-specific test suites} {-} in order to evaluate which
            tests have been passed or failed. Once again, each supported language
            will need their own implementation, at best by communicating directly
            with a testing framework (such as junit for Java or Jest for JavaScript)
            or a build tool (such as Gradle), at worst by directly parsing the text
            output of tests.
      \item \textbf{Static analysis tools} {-} in order to be used for scoring. In this
            case, a choice can be made between interfacing with more lower-level software
            specific tools, which can potentially need per-language support (such as
            Errorprone, SpotBugs for Java or ESLint for Javascript), tools which already
            support a plethora of languages out of the box (such as Infer), or higher level
            platforms which already interface on their own the lower-level tools (such as
            SonarQube)
      \item \textbf{A language interpreter} {-} to be used to declare variables and evaluate
            them to be used for the assignment of badges to students. A decision must be made
            between developing a custom language with its interpreter or the use of an already
            available interpreted language such as Javascript or Lua, with the consequent
            integration needed and the additional constraints to apply in order to disallow
            potential malicious use
\end{enumerate}
Additionally, in order to implement the gamification aspect, additional information
from each of these tools might be required in order to be able to define variables
for badges. For example, we might need to extract more metadata from git
related to number of commits by each student, lines changed, the dates of
the first/last commit, etc so that educators are able to use those.

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}
The system will need to communicate with the following external platforms:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{GitHub} {-} which is used for code-hosting. The system will need to
            communicate with GitHub using the git protocol either over HTTP or SSH in order
            to manage and interact with repositories, but will also need to possibly interact
            with the GitHub API over HTTP (using their REST API or their GraphQL API) to
            create new repositories, as well as to collect additional metadata to be used
            for gamification variables. Additionally, it will also need to receive messages
            from GitHub workflows, so an API will need to be exposed so that a workflow
            will be able to notify the system of the push of a new commit by a student
      \item \textbf{External static analysis platforms} {-} in case they are choosen to
            implement static analysis. For example if SonarQube is used, the system will
            need to be able to communicate using its API to receive reports about projects
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, the following communication protocols are used:
\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{HyperText Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer (HTTPS)} {-} used
            for all external communications
      \item \textbf{Secure Shell (SSH)} {-} used for git communications. This is to be
            preferred to HTTPS as the use of SSH certificates will also need to more easily
            and securely authenticate the system to the GitHub platform
      \item \textbf{GraphQL} {-} on top of HTTPS used for communicating with GitHub
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Requirements mapping}
\section{Performance Requirements}

\section{Design Constraints}
\subsection{Standards Compliance}
The CodeKataBattle (CKB) platform is designed with the goal of strictly adhering to several standards to ensure the quality, security and interoperability of the system.\\ The standards to which CKB adheres include:

\begin{enumerate}
      \item HTTPS Protocol Compliance\\
            Implementation of the HTTPS protocol according to the cryptographic standards established by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).

      \item Accessibility Standards\\
            Compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure web accessibility.

      \item Security Standards\\
            Implementation of security best practices as defined by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).
            Such as password storage encryption with HASH512 + Salt, SSL Certificate and end-to-end communication encryption.


      \item API Interoperability\\
            Use of open standards for API design, such as RESTful API and adherence to specifications such as OpenAPI (Swagger).


      \item Coding Standards\\
            The platform follows universally accepted coding guidelines for the main programming language used in system development (e.g., Java or Python).
            Compliance with the coding guidelines for the main programming language (PEP 8 for Python, Java Coding Conventions for Java).


      \item Compliance with Privacy Regulations\\
            Compliance with privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for European citizens.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hardware limitations}
Each student and educator must have an electronic device such as a computer or smartphone with an internet connection to
access the CKB Platform.
Students must be able to clone GitHub repositories on their device to participate in the various battles and accordingly must have a physical storage with sufficient space to store the sources and data of the various projects.
The device used must allow the student to view, edit, process and execute the sources.
The devices used by students and educators enable them to receive notifications.

\section{Software System Attributes}
\subsection{Reliability}
The CKB platform does not manage critical operations.
If an operation fails, it can be re-executed without any particular consequences.
For example, if the evaluation of an exercise fails, students can resubmit their code.
It is therefore reasonable to have a failure rate around 1\%.

\subsection{Availability}
The platform should have the lowest downtime possible during the day.
A few hours of downtime are allowed between 1am and 5am, when student are usually not studying.
The platform shall therefore guarantee 99\% (two-nines) of availability, so that 3.65 days of downtime per year are allowed.

\subsection{Security}
Communication between the user and the CBK platform is encrypted with HTTPS. %Forse non posso dirlo qua(?)
Furthermore, users must only be able to perform operations that they are authorized to do.
For example, a student must not be able to change his grade.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The system should be divided in scalable and reusable modules,
which will be easier to maintain and replace in case of failure.
Ordinary maintenance, for bug fixes and improvements, will be scheduled during night time, when the user traffic is minimal.

\subsection{Portability}
The CKD platform does not require any particular hardware or software.
It must be accessible from any operating system with a modern web browser.
A mobile application that allows users to see the state of the battles can also be developed.
Since the mobile app does not require any special function, a non-native approach can be adopted.
It is therefore possible to use cross-platform development tools, which can speed up the development process.
