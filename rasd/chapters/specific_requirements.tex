\subsection{Reliability}
The CKB platform does not manage critical operations.
If an operation fails, it can be re-executed without any particular consequences.
For example, if the evaluation of an exercise fails, students can resubmit their code.
It is therefore reasonable to have a failure rate around 1\%.

\subsection{Availability}
The platform should have the lowest downtime possible during the day.
A few hours of downtime are allowed between 1am and 5am, when student are usually not studying.
The platform shall therefore guarantee 99\% (two-nines) of availability, so that 3.65 days of downtime per year are allowed.

\subsection{Security}
Communication between the user and the CBK platform is encrypted with HTTPS. %Forse non posso dirlo qua(?)
Furthermore, users must only be able to perform operations that they are authorized to do.
For example, a student must not be able to change his grade.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The system should be divided in scalable and reusable modules, 
which will be easier to maintain and replace in case of failure. 
Ordinary maintenance, for bug fixes and improvements, will be scheduled during night time, when the user traffic is minimal.

\subsection{Portability}
The CKD platform does not require any particular hardware or software.
It must be accessible from any operating system with a modern web browser.
A mobile application that allows users to see the state of the battles can also be developed.
Since the mobile app does not require any special function, a non-native approach can be adopted.
It is therefore possible to use cross-platform development tools, which can speed up the development process.
