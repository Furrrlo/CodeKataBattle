\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the system is to help students improve their software development skills by joining code kata battles.
A code kata battle is a programming exercise created by an educator that contains a set of test cases.
Students have to provide a solution that pass the test, using a test-driven approach.
Students can try as many times as they want, each time a solution is submitted, the tests are executed and the score is calculated.

The goals of the CKB platform are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Educators can organize tournaments of programming exercises aimed at improving their students skills.
    \item Educators can organize battles in a tournament they have created.
    \item Educators can aid their colleagues in creating battles.
    \item Educator can decide how to score a battle they have created.
    \item Students can be notified about new tournaments.
    \item Students can subscribe to tournaments.
    \item Students can be notified about new battles in tournaments they are subscribed to.
    \item Students can form teams to take part in a battle.
    \item Teams of students can join a battle
    \item Students and educators can monitor the progress of all students in battles and tournaments.
    \item Educators can manage studentsâ€™ gamification badges.
    \item Students can receive badges depending on the rules they have fulfilled.
    \item Students and educators can see badges collected by a student.
