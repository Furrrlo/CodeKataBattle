\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the system is to help students improve their software development skills by joining code kata battles.
A code kata battle is a programming exercise created by an educator that contains a set of test cases.
Students have to provide a solution that pass the test, using a test-driven approach.
Students can try as many times as they want, each time a solution is submitted, the tests are executed and the score is calculated.

The goals of the CKB platform are:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{G\arabic*}:,ref=G\arabic*,leftmargin=1.3cm]
    \labelleditem{Educators can organize tournaments of programming exercises aimed at improving their students skills.}
    \labelleditem{Educators can organize battles in a tournament they have created.}
    \labelleditem{Educators can aid their colleagues in creating battles.}
    \labelleditem{Educator can decide how to score a battle they have created.}
    \labelleditem{Students can be notified about new tournaments.}

    \labelleditem{Students can be notified about new battles in tournaments they are subscribed to.}
    \labelleditem{Students can form teams to take part in a battle.}
    \labelleditem{Teams of students can join a battle}
    \labelleditem{Students and educators can monitor the progress of all students in battles and tournaments.}
    \labelleditem{Educators can manage studentsâ€™ gamification badges.}
    \labelleditem{Students can receive badges depending on the rules they have fulfilled.}
    \labelleditem{Students and educators can see badges collected by a student.}

\section{Scope}
The platform is intended to be used in a school or university context.
Educators are the professors who teach in the school.\\
The platform interact with an existing login system (SSO), responsible for authenticating users.

The platform will allow an educator to create tournaments and battles within the context of a tournament he have created.
The educator can also grant other colleagues the permission to create battles within the context of his tournaments.

When the submission deadline of a battle expires, if the educator enabled manual evaluation, there is a consolidation stage.
During this stage, the educator who create the battle uses the platform to go through the sources produced by each team to assign his/her score.
After grading all groups, he can close the consolidation stage.\\
Otherwise, if manual evaluation is not required, when the submission deadline expires, the battle is automatically closed.

After the battle is closed, the final battle rank becomes available and all students who participated are notified.

After all battles in a tournaments are closed, the educator who create the tournament can close it.

The creator of the tournament can also create badges.
Each badge has a set of rules that must be fulfilled to achieve it.
The rules are written using a language \comment{capire come funziona sta roba} and are based on variables.
When writing a rule, educators can use predefined variables, or create new ones that represent any piece of information available in the platform relevant for scoring.
