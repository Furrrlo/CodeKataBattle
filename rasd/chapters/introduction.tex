\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the system is to help students improve their software development skills by joining Code Kata Battles.
A Code Kata Battle is a programming exercise created by an educator that contains a set of test cases.
Students have to provide a solution that passes the tests, using a test-driven approach.
Students can try as many times as they want, each time a solution is submitted, the tests are executed and the score is calculated.

The goals of the CKB platform are:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{G\arabic*}:,ref=G\arabic*,leftmargin=1.3cm]
    \labelleditem{Educators can organize tournaments of programming exercises aimed at improving their students' skills.}
    \labelleditem{Educators can organize battles in a tournament they have created.}
    \labelleditem{Educators can aid their colleagues in creating battles.}
    \labelleditem{Educator can decide how to score a battle they have created.}
    \labelleditem{Students can be notified about new tournaments.}
    \labelleditem{Students can subscribe to tournaments.}
    \labelleditem{Students can be notified about new battles in tournaments they are subscribed to.}
    \labelleditem{Students can form teams to take part in a battle.}
    \labelleditem{Teams of students can join a battle}
    \labelleditem{Students and educators can monitor the progress of all students in battles and tournaments.}
    \labelleditem{Educators can manage studentsâ€™ gamification badges.}
    \labelleditem{Students can receive badges depending on the rules they have fulfilled.}
    \labelleditem{Students and educators can see badges collected by a student.}

\section{Scope}
The platform is intended to be used in a school or university context.
Educators are the professors who teach in the school.\\
The platform interact with an existing login system (SSO), responsible for authenticating users.

The platform will allow an educator to create tournaments and battles within the context of a tournament he have created.
The educator can also grant other colleagues the permission to create battles within the context of his tournaments.

The creator of the tournament can also create badges.
Each badge has a set of rules that must be fulfilled to achieve it.
The rules are simple expressions on variables that returns a boolean value.
For example:
\begin{lstlisting}
    tot_attended_battles > 0
\end{lstlisting}
or
\begin{lstlisting}
    tot_commits_student == max_tot_commits
\end{lstlisting}
where \lstinline{tot_attended_battles}, \lstinline{tot_commits_student} and \lstinline{max_tot_commits} are pre-defined variables.\\
To create more complex rule and avoid duplicated code, educators can create new variables.
In particular, they can use an interpreted language to define new variables based on the existing ones.
For example, if the platform provides the variables \lstinline{tot_attended_battles}and \lstinline{tot_battles},
educators can create a new variable \lstinline{tot_missed_battles} as
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java, morekeywords={var}, keywordstyle=\color{blue}]
    var tot_missed_battles = tot_battles - tot_attended_battles;
\end{lstlisting}

To create a battle, the educator needs to upload test cases and build automation scripts.
Uploading test cases he can decide if each test is public or private.
Public tests are provided to students, so that they can run them locally.
Private tests are used for automatic evaluation, but they are not provided to students.
In this way educator are sure that students are not writing code that only pass specific tests, but actually solves the exercise.

When the registration deadline of a battle expires, the platform creates a GitHub repository containing build automation scripts and public tests provided by the educator.
All subscribed students receive a notification.
One student per group forks the repository and adds his teammates as collaborators.\\
The forked repository contains also a workflows that triggers the CKB platform on each push.
The student needs to enable the GitHub Actions to make it work.
The student also have to insert the link of his repository in the CKB platform, so that only authorized repositories can trigger the platform.

When the submission deadline of a battle expires, if the educator enabled manual evaluation, there is a consolidation stage.
During this stage, the educator who create the battle uses the platform to go through the sources produced by each team to assign his/her score.
After grading all groups, he can close the consolidation stage.\\
Otherwise, if manual evaluation is not required, when the submission deadline expires, the battle is automatically closed.

After the battle is closed, the final battle rank becomes available and all students who participated are notified.

After all battles in a tournaments are closed, the educator who create the tournament can close it.

    \item \textbf{Section 2: Overall Description} \\
          This section contains a description of the entirety of the problem, detailing its domain,
          including assumptions that must hold true, as well as how its state changes in time
          and possible usage scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Section 1: Specific Requirements} \\
          This section describes the specific requirements of the system. It provides a detailed analysis
          of the external interfaces, both user-facing as well as hardware and software, and presents the
          performance requirements, standards compliance and software system attributes.
          Additionally, it describes in depth the functional requirements of the system and details the
          use cases by means of diagrams, mapping goals, requirements and domains and tracing each use
          case to the requirements it satisfies.
    \item \textbf{Section 1: Formal Analysis through Alloy} \\
          This section provides a formal analysis using the alloy language, in order
          to prove the correctness and soundness of the system described in the previous sections.
