	      Next, he clicks on the list of educators selecting educators Gianpaolo Mariani, Mario Rossi, and Rosa Ballabio as he wants to allow them also to be able to create new
	      battles for the tournament he is creating.\\
	      Accordingly, he clicks on the Create Tournament button and the platform shows a message of successful tournament creation.
	      Luca will be shown the \emph{DETAIL\_TOURNAMENT} page of the newly created \emph{"Welcome Tournament School Year 2024"} for which, at the moment, as an empty list of
	      available
	      battles.
	      All students enrolled in the CKB Platform will be notified about the new creation of the tournament created by educator Luca.




	\item \textbf{Battle Creation by and Educator for an Existing Tournament}\\
	      Gianpaolo Mariani is an educator registered with the CKB Platform and wants to create a battle for the \emph{"Welcome Tournament School Year 2024"} tournament.\\
	      After logging in, the \emph{HOMEPAGE} shows the list of tournaments he has created or to which he has been added by other contributors. Gianpaolo clicks on the \emph{"Welcome
		      Tournament School Year 2024"} line found in the list of tournaments mentioned earlier.\\
	      After clicking, the platform shows the \emph{DETAIL\_TOURNAMENT} page of the selected tournament.
	      On the \emph{DETAIL\_TOURNAMENT} page, Gianpaolo clicks on the \emph{"Create New Battle"} button and the \emph{CREATE\_BATTLE} page is shown to him.\\
	      The \emph{CREATE\_BATTLE} page contains:

	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Kata Code Upload Section

	      and maximum number of students as 3, and does not edit any of the default entries in the Scoring Configuration section as he plans to edit it later before the battle is
	      actually started.\\
	      After that, he clicks on the Create Battle button and the platform redirect Gianpaolo to the \emph{DETAIL\_TOURNAMENT} page containing the new created battle in the list of available battles.
	      All students who had signed up for the tournament will receive a notification of the newly added battle created by educator Gianpaolo.



	\item \textbf{Student joins to an existing Tournament by receiving a notification}\\
	      Marco is an University student and thus is registered on the CKB Platform (ASSUMPTION). He wants to sign up for a tournament to improve his programming skills in Java as he notices that he has difficulty writing code using Object Oriented Programming. In the afternoon Marco receives a notification of a new tournament creation called \emph{"The Basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Java"}, he decides to take the opportunity and sign up.\\
	      Therefore, he accesses the platform by logging in and the platform redirect him to the \emph{HOMEPAGE}. Marco clicks on the record \emph{"The Basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Java"} listed in the list of available Tournaments for which he is not subscribed.\\
	      The platform shows Marco the \emph{SUBSCRIPTION\_TO\_A\_TOURNAMENT} page.\\
	      The \emph{SUBSCRIPTION\_TO\_A\_TOURNAMENT}  page shows information about the name and the description of the selected tournament. \\
	      Marco clicks on the Subscribe button, and the platform enrolls Marco in the tournament showing a confirmation registration message.

	\item \textbf{Students create a team for a tournament battle}\\
	      Marco, Stefano, and Carlo are students enrolled in \emph{"Welcome Tournament School Year 2024"} tournament.\\
	      They want to participate in one of the available tournament battles by creating a team.
	      Specifically, Marco logs in and in the \emph{HOMEPAGE} clicks on the tournament from the list of tournaments in which he is registered.\\
	      Marco is shown the \emph{DETAIL\_TOURNAMENT} page and within it he clicks on the first available battle.\\
	      He is shown the \emph{DETAIL\_BATTLE} page and clicks on the \emph{"Participate by creating a team"} button.\\
	      Marco already knows Stefano and decides to invite him to join his team, Stefano receives the a notification of the invitation and
	      clicks it to accept right away.\\
	      Because the tournament has a minimum requirement of 3 people, Marco leaves the page, in hopes to find the missing element to partecipate.\\
	      At a later time, Marco comes back on the page and invites Carlo, which he has just met during a lecture.\\
	      Carlo misses the notification, so he logs in and in the \emph{HOMEPAGE} finds the invitation. He clicks on the
	      \emph{accept} button.\\
	      Once Carlo has accepted, Marco goes back to the \emph{DETAIL\_TOURNAMENT} page, where he can see the team he has formed,
	      and clicks on the \emph{"Participate with the current team"} button.

	\item \textbf{Platform creates the GitHub repository when a battle's registration deadline expires}\\
	      Gianpaolo Mariano is an educator on the platform and had created a battle within the \emph{"Welcome Tournament School Year 2024"} tournament context with registration deadline 6/11/2023.\\
	      The system, when the registration deadline of the battle expires, creates the GitHub repository containing the code kata specified by Gianpaolo for the battle and sends the link of the newly created repository to all students who have registered in teams before the registration deadline expired.


	\item \textbf{Calculation of a team battle and personal students score}\\
	      Marco is a student and is participating in a battle with the team consisting of Stefano and Carlo.\\
	      Marco edits the project code and commits and pushes to the forked GitHub repository. \\
	      The platform fetches the code, analyzes it, and runs the prepared tests (test cases) for the battle in which the team is participating.\\
	      The platform updates the team's battle score by considering:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item The number of successfully passed test cases
		      \item The number of days that have passed since the end of the registration deadline
		      \item The quality level of the sources extracted from the static analysis tools
	      \end{enumerate}
	      The platform also modifies each student's personal tournament score by summing all the battle scores received in that tournament.\\
	      Therefore, after the update, Marco,Stefano and Carlo go to the \emph{DETAIL\_BATTLE} page and view the new battle and tournament score assigned to them automatically by the platform.\\





	\item \textbf{Begin of Consolidation Stage when submission deadline of a battle expires}\\
	      Gianpaolo Mariano is a platform educator and had created a battle for the \emph{"Welcome Tournament School Year 2024"} with final submission deadline as 23/12/2023.\\
	      The platform at the end of the final submission deadline declares the start of the consolidation stage due to the fact that Gianpaolo had selected the \emph{"manual evaluation"} option for the battle he created.\\
	      Gianpaolo proceeds by hand analyzing the code submitted by the various groups and, in particular, decides to increase the score by +2 obtained by the group of students composed of Marco, Stefano and Carlo.\\
	      Afterwards, Gianpaolo using the platform declares the consolidation stage closed.\\
	      Marco, Stefano and Carlo and all other students who participated in the tournament battle receive a notification with the final battle rank.


	\item \textbf{Closing a tournament}\\
	      Luca Proserpio is a platform educator who had created the \emph{"Welcome Tournament School Year 2024"} tournament.\\
	      In March 2024, Luca decides to close the tournament.\\
	      All students enrolled in the CKB Platform will be notified about the closure of the Tournament.\\
	      Gianpaolo had also created the following gamification badges:
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item \emph{"Start2024_with_the_right_foot"}: awarded to all students enrolled in the tournament.
		      \item \emph{"Participant_2024"}: awarded to all students who have made at least 1 commit in any battle present in the tournament
	      \end{enumerate}
	      The platform analyzes all the details of the students who had registered for the tournament and accordingly assigns all students who met the requirements the relevant badges created by Luca.\\
	      In particular, Marco, Stefano, and Carlo had participated in several battles in the tournament and therefore receive both badges.\\
	      Samuele is another student who signed up for the tournament but never participated in any battle within the tournament, as a result the platform only assigns him the \emph{"Start2024_with_the_right_foot"} badge.

\end{enumerate}
